# Learn-Bootstrap
Here are the files from my videos where i go though the basics of Bootstrap.

I only recently started learning it myself and it has been a blast!
I can't say that that I will miss having to create a grid layout from scratch, 
painstakingly writing every tag and attribute to every element using only the code I could come up with.

NOTE! I recommend that you learn, at least, the basics of HTML5 and traditional CSS before using Bootstrap!5
